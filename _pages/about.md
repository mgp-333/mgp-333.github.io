About me
======
I am a Phd Student in Computer Science at the University of California Riverside. I was born in Los Angeles and grew up in El Monte, CA. Then did my undergrad at UCLA. My academic interests include: contrastive learning,  I am also interested in education as  means for socio-economic mobility, and supporting foster youth. My hobbies are hiking, reading and paintball. 

Portfolio Projects
------

### Conformal Prediction:
Conformal Prediction is a useful framework for quantifying uncertainty in a distribution free method. I am interested in applying this framework to machine learning problems. 

### Contrastive Learning:
Contrastive learning is . I am interested in applying contrastive learning techniques to unsupervised learning and improving methodologies. 


### Tensor Completion:
Tensor completion describes the problem faced when dealing with incomplete or sparse data. Tensor completion involves filling missing/unobserved entries of partially observed tensors. I am interested in using tensor completion for sparese and incomplete high dimensional datasets.

### Spatiotempoeral: 

### Splines:
Splines are functions defined piecewise by sets of polynomials. These polynomials each have a specific interval. Splines can be applied to neural networks in machine learning through their use as activation functions and using basis splines. I am interested in using splines for regularization and other machine learning applications.

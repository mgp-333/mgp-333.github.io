This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool. 

Main Contributions:
======
1- generalize and apply Information-Theoretic framework and extend this from contrastive tasks to poly view. Thus this results in a new class of representation learning algorithms
2- apply "sufficient statistics" to provide additional view and show that two views reduces to SIM-CLR loss. Thus this results in a family of representation learning objectives
3- demonstrate that poly-view contrastive learning is useful for image representation

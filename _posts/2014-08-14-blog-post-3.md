SHORT INTRO:
======
Contrastive learning framework seeks to maximize mutual information.


Main Contributions:
======
1- generalize and apply Information-Theoretic framework and extend this from contrastive tasks to poly view. Thus this results in a new class of representation learning algorithms
2- apply "sufficient statistics" to provide additional view and show that two views reduces to SIM-CLR loss. Thus this results in a family of representation learning objectives
3- demonstrate that poly-view contrastive learning is useful for image representation 

KEY CONCEPTS:
======
MI- mutual information, contrastive learning seeks to maximize this

EXPERIMENTS:
======
1. Synthetic 1D Gaussian
2. Real World Image Representation
3.

RESULTS:
======

FUTURE WORK:
======
